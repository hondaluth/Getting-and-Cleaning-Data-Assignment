# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Assignment

This assignment assumes you have loaded "data.table", and that the data is upladed to your working directory.

1. This loads the test data, then the training data, then the lookup information.
2. It merges the data from step 1.
3. This merged data is exported to a "merged_tidy_data.txt" file.
4. A new table is made merging these called "calculated_tidy_data.txt" which is the final solution.
